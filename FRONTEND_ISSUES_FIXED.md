# Frontend Issues Fixed - User Feedback Response

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Own Listing Functionality Issues

**Problem**: Users could add their own listings to wishlist and review their own listings, which doesn't make sense.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Wishlist Button**: Now only shows for non-owners (`{user && !isOwner && ...}`)
- **Review Form**: Now only shows for non-owners (`{user && !userReview && !isOwner && ...}`)

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: {user && (
// After: {user && !isOwner && (
```

### 2. ✅ Calendar Availability Enhancement

**Problem**: Calendar input was just a text field, not user-friendly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Date Picker**: Added HTML5 date input with minimum date validation
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows selected dates before saving
- **Better UX**: "Add Date" button to add individual dates

**New Features**:
- Date picker with future date validation
- Visual display of selected dates
- Improved user interface

### 3. ✅ Review Deletion Issue

**Problem**: "Failed to delete review" error when trying to delete reviews.

**Root Cause**: Using deprecated `review.remove()` method.

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Before: await review.remove();
// After: await Review.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
```

**Location**: `backend/controllers/reviewController.js`

### 4. ✅ Image Loading Issue

**Problem**: Uploaded images not displaying properly.

**Root Cause**: Frontend not constructing full image URLs correctly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **ListingDetail.jsx**: Fixed image URL construction with proper backend URL
- **ListingCard.jsx**: Fixed image URL construction for listing cards
- **Error Handling**: Added fallback images and error handling

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: src={listing.images[currentImageIndex]}
// After: src={`${process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL?.replace('/api', '') || 'http://localhost:5000'}${listing.images[currentImageIndex]}`}
```

### 5. ✅ Message Visibility Issue

**Problem**: Listing owners couldn't see messages sent to their listings.

**Root Cause**: Message fetching was based on user conversation, not listing-specific messages.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Message Fetching**: Changed from conversation-based to listing-based
- **Message Display**: Now shows for both owners and guests
- **UI Enhancement**: Added timestamps and better message display
- **Owner View**: Owners can see all messages for their listing but can't send new ones

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: api.get(`/messages/conversation/${listing.owner._id}`)
// After: api.get(`/messages/listing/${listing._id}`)

// Before: Only non-owners could see messages
// After: Both owners and guests can see messages
```
